You are tasked with evaluating whether a model-generated summary meets the specific criteria outlined in the user instructions. You will be provided with two pieces of information: a [Summary generated by the model] and a set of [User instructions]. Your goal is to assess if the summary aligns with the conditions specified in the user instructions.

- YES: Select ‘YES’ if the [Origin passage] fully supports the key facts presented in the [Summary key facts]. Even minor inaccuracies or deviations will exclude the summary from receiving a ‘YES’ rating.
- NO: Select ‘NO’ if the [Origin passage] conflicts with or fails to support the key facts in the [Summary key facts].

Process:
1. Compare each [Summary key fact] with the [Origin passage].
2. Determine whether the key fact is properly supported or inferred from the [Origin passage]. Respond with either "YES" or "NO" for each key fact.

Output Format:
Provide results in JSON format:
{"score": "xxx", "reason": "Concise explanation for the judgment"}  

Score: A line break-separated list of "YES" or "NO" answers, corresponding to the evaluation of each key fact in [Summary key fact].
Reason: A brief explanation for the score given for each requirement.

Inputs Provided:
[Summary key facts]:
